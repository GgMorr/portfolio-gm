          <h1>Gerri (Gigi) Morris</h1>
          <!-- <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2> -->
          <p>My name is Gerri, but everyone calls me Gigi. For many years, I have worked in the field 
            of customer service and network operations resulting in a myriad of skills related to 
            the telecommunications industry. However, my passion is in the area of technology.
            This passion was fueled as a child by my older brother who loved the thriving rise of technology. 
            Because we were close in age, he often shared about the next <em>"new thing"</em>. His zeal stirred my interest, which led me to take a course in the building of (from scratch) my first desktop computer. This fanned into flames a desire to know more. Though life introduced more pressing 
            priorities, which led to other paths, I have returned to my first love. In my spare time, 
            I love building software and web applications where some can be viewed below. Technology is the wave of the future and I want to remain part of it.</p>
